building a ML model based on the infamous titanicDataset



## Model building walkaround

- Convert the sex feature from object to integer type by assigning 1 to male and 0 to female

- #### Tackle nan/null values
- fill the embarked column with the most frequect value in the column
- might find some other relation with pclass feature to fill null values more efficiently
- seperate cabin number and cabin letter
